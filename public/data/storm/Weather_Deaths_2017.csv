Storm survey evidence of hurricane-force wind gusts include:  From Ohio, Missouri, Bahia Honda through Little Torch Keys, the strongest estimated winds were evident, possibly attributable to a mesoscale eyewall vortex circulation within the northeast quadrant of the eyewall.  A general path of of maximum wind damage occurred from the western end of Scout Key, just south of Big Pine Key Park, through Key Deer Boulevard north of South Street.  Complete roof structure failure involving snapped wood trusses was observed on several homes along with complete exterior wall failure on one waterfront home.  The path continued across Key Deer Boulevard where utility pole both of wood and hollow-spun concrete design were snapped with numerous spans lying in completely opposite directions.  The southern spans opposite to the direction of the mean wind.  Peak wind gusts were estimated 150 to 160 mph along the northern side of the apparent circulation.  Elsewhere across Big Pine Key, significant roofing loss and collapse of exterior walls on older mobile homes, large sections of roof coverings of all types, soffet damage and large metal roof, wall and door failures on modern metal building systems indicated more widespread estimated peak wind gusts of 120 to 130 mph.  From Ramrod Key through Sugarloaf Key, widespread business and residential roof covering damage of all types was observed, with isolated roof truss or gable end failures of older design.  It was noted a diagonal metal cross brace on an electric power transmission line across Niles Channel became detached from one vertical concrete column, indicative of significant deformation or flexing of the transmission towers.  Estimated peak wind gusts of 110 to 120 mph were attributed to this damage.  From Lower Sugarloaf Key through Big Coppitt Key, widespread small residential and business roof coverings with isolated structural gale end or overhang damage was noted especially in areas of open north wind exposure.  Isolated mobile home destruction including collapse of all walls was observed, although some modern mobile homes adjacent to properties with severe destruction exhibited few signs of cosmetic damage.  Estimated peak wind gusts 100 to 110 mph were attributed.  From Boca Chica Key through Key West, losses of roof coverings, soffet damage to residential homes and condominiums were noted, with two hotels exhibiting gable-end wood truss failures and sheathing of both mid-rise and two-story design.  Peak estimated wind gusts 90 to 100 mph were attributed, although the hotel mid-rise roof structure failure was in an area of open north wind exposure directly off the Gulf of Mexico may have indicated wind gusts in the 100 to 110 mph range.

Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida.

Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County.
